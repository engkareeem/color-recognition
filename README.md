## Computer Vision Project: Real-time Drawing Application

Welcome to the real-time drawing application repository! This project utilizes computer vision techniques to enable users to draw on-screen in real-time using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The application detects different colored objects as drawing tools and allows users to interact with the canvas by moving their hands.

## Features
- **Real-time Drawing**: Draw on-screen in real-time using hand gestures detected by the webcam.
- **Multiple Drawing Colors**: Different colored objects can be used as drawing tools, providing a variety of colors for drawing.
- **Clear Canvas Option**: Clear the drawing canvas by holding a specific colored object in front of the webcam.
- **Zooming and Screenshot**: Perform zooming gestures to zoom in and out of the canvas, and capture screenshots by making specific hand gestures.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**: Utilized for webcam input, image processing, and contour detection.
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the real-time drawing application.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Math Module**: Utilized for mathematical calculations, such as distance calculation between hand keypoints.

## Usage
To use the application:
1. Ensure you have a webcam connected to your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the necessary Python libraries: OpenCV, NumPy.
4. Run the `main.py` script.
5. Use colored objects (e.g., red, green, blue) to draw on the canvas in real-time.
6. Clear the canvas by holding a specific colored object in front of the webcam.


## Future Improvements
- Implement additional drawing tools and options, such as brush size and eraser.
- Enhance the user interface to provide a more intuitive drawing experience.
- Optimize hand gesture detection algorithms for better performance and accuracy.
- Add support for saving and loading drawings.
